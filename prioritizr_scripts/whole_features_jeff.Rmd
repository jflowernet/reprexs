}

#notes JF: This makes a constraint for each combination of seamount level planning unit and grid-cell level planning unit that overlaps with that seamount. The contraint says that the solution cannot have both representation of the seamount area in the seamount level planning unit AND the grid-cell level planning unit, i.e. you can't select both the seamount and then select grid-cells that overlap the seamount, only one or the other.

```

```{r}

# solve problem
raw_sol <- solve(prob)

# since the solution contains a combination of grid cell-level and
# seamount-level planning units, we need to do some post-processing
# to identify which "real" planning units (i.e. raster pixels) were selected
pu_ids <- unique(unlist(pu_data$id[which(raw_sol$solution_1 > 0.5)]))

# we can now use these values to create a raster
sol <- pu_raster * 0
sol[pu_ids] <- 1
names(sol) <- "solution"

# plot solution
plot(sol)
```

```{r}
#check feature representation - can't do this using prioritizr functions due to overlapping areas

features_stack <- stack(fish_stack, seamount_raster)

for(i in 1:nlayers(features_stack)){
  feature_temp <- features_stack[[i]]
  overlapping_cells <- feature_temp * sol
  plot(overlapping_cells)
  perc_representation <- 100*(cellStats(overlapping_cells, sum, na.rm = TRUE)/cellStats(feature_temp, sum, na.rm =TRUE))
  print(perc_representation)
}
